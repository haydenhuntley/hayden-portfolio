      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 5, 2025</p>

      <p>
        This Cookie Policy explains how Hayden Huntley ("I", "me", or "my") uses
        cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit my
        website (e.g., www.haydenhuntley.com). It explains what these
        technologies are and why I use them.
      </p>

      <h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device (computer,
        tablet, smartphone) when you visit a website. They help websites
        recognize your device, remember your preferences, and improve your
        experience.
      </p>

      <h2>How I Use Cookies</h2>
      <p>I use cookies for one purpose only:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Analytics and Performance:</strong> I use Google Analytics to
          collect information about how visitors use my website. This includes
          data like the pages you visit, how long you stay, how you arrived at
          the site, and your general geographic location (not your exact
          address). This information helps me understand how my website is used
          so I can improve it over time.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Google Analytics may set cookies on your device to collect this
        information. The data collected is aggregated and anonymous â€” it does
        not identify you personally.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can learn more about how Google uses information from sites that use
        their services by visiting:
        <a
          href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites"
          target="_blank"
          >Google's Policy Page</a
        >.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Choices</h2>
      <p>
        You can control or delete cookies through your browser settings. Most
        browsers allow you to block or delete cookies. However, disabling
        cookies may impact how well my website functions for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        To opt out of Google Analytics tracking across all websites, you can
        install the
        <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank"
          >Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a
        >.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        I may update this Cookie Policy from time to time. If I make significant
        changes, I will update the effective date at the top of this page.
      </p>
